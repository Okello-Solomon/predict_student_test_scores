## Project Overview

This project predicts student test scores based on demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors using a Linear Regression model.
The model is trained, evaluated using cross-validation, and deployed through an interactive Streamlit web application.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow:

data preprocessing → feature engineering → model evaluation → deployment

### Features

- Predicts student test scores in real time

- Handles categorical, ordinal, binary, and numerical features

- Uses Linear Regression for interpretable predictions

 - Applies proper encoding and feature scaling

- Ensures consistent preprocessing between training and deployment

- Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface

### Machine Learning Model

**Model Used:** Linear Regression

**Objective:** Predict continuous exam scores

**Evaluation Metric:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2_Score

**Validation Strategy:** 
- Cross-Validation

- Linear Regression was selected due to its:

- Strong baseline performance

- Interpretability

- Stability on structured tabular dat
